	<h1>This is the <i>best</i> motherfucking website.</h1>
	Really, it is.
	<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
	You probablu build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to pu on your damn footer as a link.
	You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
	<br>
	<p><span class="wr">WRONG</span> , motherfucker.</p>
	<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
	Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the flory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shit doest weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed</li>
		<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.fr">Google home page</a></li>
		<li>First on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your famn 16x32 Tamagotchi</li>
		<li>Looks <i>almost the same on every screen</i></li>
		<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well kind of</small></li>
		<li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it<small>but not everyone can read this - text is Anti-Accessible</small></li>
		<li>Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a></li>
		<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
		<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans"<small>wich btw weights 15.21, wtf</small></li>
		<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
		<li>Doesn't include any tracking service<small>this website does, but hey,who cares</small></li>
		<li>Image aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
		<li>
			Use <i>some</i> fucking <span id=rbw class="colored" style=rgb(235, 71, 207);"
			>colors</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			Links don't reallu need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a nice <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa"></a>color.</li>
	</ul>
